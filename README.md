# odin-landing-page
Project: Landing Page from The Odin Project

Built index.html and style.css from scratch. Only used the <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png" target="_blank">website image</a> and <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png" target="_blank">style guidelines</a> from The Odin Project to create the landing page structure and design.

All copy is original, and photos were taken by me during a trip to EPCOT.
